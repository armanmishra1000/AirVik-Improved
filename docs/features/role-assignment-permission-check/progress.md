## Feature Status: COMPLETE
See CURRENT-STATE.md for details

## Contract Files Available:
✅ shared/contracts/api/role-api.contract.ts - Complete role assignment API endpoints
✅ shared/contracts/services/role-service.contract.ts - Role service layer methods  
✅ shared/contracts/middleware/permission-middleware.contract.ts - Permission checking middleware
✅ shared/contracts/models/user.contract.ts - User model with role field
✅ shared/contracts/api/response.contract.ts - Standard response format

## Infrastructure Ready:
✅ User authentication system (login/logout)
✅ User registration with email verification  
✅ Password reset functionality
✅ JWT token management
✅ MongoDB connection and models
✅ Basic middleware and error handling

## Next Steps:
1. Complete all frontend tasks (F1-F5) 
2. Test frontend components with mock data
3. Connect frontend to backend APIs
4. Test end-to-end functionality
5. Deploy and validate complete feature

## Critical Requirements:
- MUST use exact property names from shared/contracts/
- MUST follow existing authentication middleware patterns
- MUST use exact response format: { success: boolean, data?: T, error?: string }
- MUST implement role hierarchy: ADMIN > STAFF > USER  
- MUST implement permission system with role-based access
