- Features: Complete schema with validation, indexes, and static methods
- Tested: Successfully created test documents and queries
- Git: commit 7c93a03 - "feat(role-assignment): add role audit log MongoDB schema with validation and indexes"

## Current State:
See CURRENT-STATE.md for details

## Contract Files Available:
✅ shared/contracts/api/role-api.contract.ts - Complete role assignment API endpoints
✅ shared/contracts/services/role-service.contract.ts - Role service layer methods  
✅ shared/contracts/middleware/permission-middleware.contract.ts - Permission checking middleware
✅ shared/contracts/models/user.contract.ts - User model with role field
✅ shared/contracts/api/response.contract.ts - Standard response format

## Infrastructure Ready:
✅ User authentication system (login/logout)
✅ User registration with email verification  
✅ Password reset functionality
✅ JWT token management
✅ MongoDB connection and models
✅ Basic middleware and error handling

## Next Steps:
1. Start with Task B1 using the task prompt from task-prompts.md
2. Complete all backend tasks (B1-B6) before starting frontend
3. Test backend thoroughly with Postman after each task
4. Complete frontend tasks (F1-F5) after backend is done
5. Test end-to-end functionality

## Critical Requirements:
- MUST use exact property names from shared/contracts/
- MUST follow existing authentication middleware patterns
- MUST use exact response format: { success: boolean, data?: T, error?: string }
- MUST implement role hierarchy: ADMIN > STAFF > USER  
- MUST implement permission system with role-based access
