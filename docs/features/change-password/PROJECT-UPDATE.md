### Change Password
**Status:** âœ… Completed  
**Developer:** [Name]  
**Branch:** feature/change-password  
**Completed:** [Date]

**Description:** Complete change password system allowing authenticated users to securely update their password with current password verification, comprehensive validation, and seamless integration with existing authentication infrastructure.

**Files Created/Modified:**

*Backend Extensions:*
- Extended `backend/src/services/auth/user-auth.service.ts` - Added changePassword method with current password verification
- Extended `backend/src/controllers/auth/user-auth.controller.ts` - Added change password endpoint with validation
- Extended `backend/src/routes/auth.routes.ts` - Added PUT /api/v1/auth/change-password route with rate limiting
- Extended `postman/user-registration-email-verification.postman_collection.json` - Added change password endpoint tests

*Frontend:*
- Extended `frontend/src/types/auth.types.ts` - Added ChangePasswordRequest/Response type definitions
- Extended `frontend/src/services/auth.service.ts` - Added changePassword API method with authentication
- Created `frontend/src/components/auth/ChangePasswordForm.tsx` - Change password form with validation and strength indicator
- Created `frontend/src/app/change-password/page.tsx` - Change password page with proper layout

*Documentation:*
- Created comprehensive feature documentation in `docs/features/change-password/`
- AI memory system with CURRENT-STATE.md, API-CONTRACT.md, TASK-LIST.md
- Complete task prompts for copy-paste implementation
- Integration tests and problem tracking documentation

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Secure password change requiring current password verification
- Comprehensive password strength validation (min 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, special char)
- Real-time form validation with visual feedback and password strength indicator
- JWT authentication integration with existing token management
- Rate limiting (5 attempts per 15 minutes) to prevent brute force attacks
- Responsive UI design matching existing auth form patterns
- Full API integration with comprehensive error handling
- Session maintenance after successful password change

**Integration Points:**
- Seamlessly integrates with existing JWT authentication system
- Uses existing User model comparePassword method for current password verification
- Leverages existing bcrypt password hashing via model pre-save hook
- Follows established API contract patterns (/api/v1/auth/* endpoints)
- Reuses authentication middleware and response utility patterns
- Maintains consistency with existing form validation and error handling

**Shared Code Created:**
- Password strength validation utilities that can be reused for other password input forms
- Change password API service patterns that demonstrate secure authenticated API calls
- Form validation patterns with real-time feedback for sensitive input fields
- Integration with existing authentication middleware for protected operations

**Lessons Learned:**
- Extension of existing services is more efficient than creating new ones for related functionality
- Current password verification is essential for security in password change operations
- Real-time password strength feedback significantly improves user experience
- Proper integration testing ensures new features don't break existing authentication flows
- Rate limiting on password change endpoints prevents abuse while maintaining usability
