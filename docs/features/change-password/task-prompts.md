## Backend Task B1: Extend Auth Service Layer

**MANDATORY FIRST STEPS:**

Read and analyze: docs/features/change-password/CURRENT-STATE.md
Read and analyze: docs/features/change-password/API-CONTRACT.md
Read and analyze: docs/features/change-password/spec.md
Read and analyze: docs/features/change-password/api.md

List what you found to prove you read them

**CONTEXT:**
You are implementing change-password feature. The developer using this is a beginner who only copies prompts.

**YOUR TASK:**
Extend existing auth service to add changePassword method

**FILE TO MODIFY:**
`backend/src/services/auth/user-auth.service.ts` (MAXIMUM 50 lines addition)

**REQUIREMENTS FROM SPEC:**
- Add changePassword method that takes userId, currentPassword, newPassword
- Verify currentPassword using existing comparePassword method
- Validate newPassword meets requirements (min 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, special char)
- Update password in database (triggers existing bcrypt hashing via pre-save hook)
- Return success message matching API-CONTRACT.md exactly

**CODE STRUCTURE:**
```typescript
export const changePassword = async (
  userId: string,
  currentPassword: string,
  newPassword: string
): Promise<{ message: string }> => {
  // 1. Find user by ID
  // 2. Verify current password using comparePassword
  // 3. Validate new password requirements
  // 4. Update password (triggers pre-save hook)
  // 5. Return success message
};
```

**DO NOT:**
- Create new files
- Exceed 50 lines addition
- Change existing methods
- Add new dependencies

**GIT OPERATIONS:**
After extending the file successfully:
- Stage changes: `git add backend/src/services/auth/user-auth.service.ts`
- Commit with message: `git commit -m "feat(change-password): add changePassword method to auth service"`
- Push to remote: `git push origin feature/change-password`

**AFTER COMPLETING:**
Update docs/features/change-password/CURRENT-STATE.md:
- Add to "What Exists Now": âœ… backend/src/services/auth/user-auth.service.ts - changePassword method added
- Update "Next Task": B2

Update docs/features/change-password/progress.md:
- Mark B1 as completed
- Add to "Git Status": Last commit hash and message

**TEST YOUR WORK:**
The developer will test by calling the service method directly
