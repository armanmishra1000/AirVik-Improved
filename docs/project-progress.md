### User Registration & Email Verification
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Developer:** Yash Sheliya  
**Branch:** feature/user-registration-email-verification  
**Completed:** 2025-07-28

**Description:** Complete user registration system with email verification, including secure password hashing, JWT token generation, email sending, and comprehensive frontend forms.

**Files Created:**

*Backend:*
- `backend/src/models/user.model.ts` - User model with email verification fields
- `backend/src/services/auth/user-auth.service.ts` - Auth service with email verification logic
- `backend/src/controllers/auth/user-auth.controller.ts` - Auth controllers with validation
- `backend/src/routes/auth.routes.ts` - Auth routes with rate limiting

*Frontend:*
- `frontend/src/types/auth.types.ts` - TypeScript type definitions
- `frontend/src/services/auth.service.ts` - API service for auth calls
- `frontend/src/app/auth/register/page.tsx` - Registration page
- `frontend/src/app/auth/verify-email/page.tsx` - Email verification page

*Testing:*
- `postman/user-registration-email-verification.postman_collection.json` - Complete API tests

**Key Features Implemented:**
- User registration with email/password
- Email verification with secure tokens
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT token generation
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- Comprehensive form validation
- Responsive UI design
- Error handling and user feedback
- Resend verification email functionality

## Shared Infrastructure
### Backend
- Database connection: `backend/src/config/database.ts`
- Error handling: `backend/src/middleware/error.middleware.ts`
- Response utilities: `backend/src/utils/response.utils.ts`
- Rate limiting middleware: Used in auth routes (can be extracted for reuse)
- JWT utilities: Implemented in auth service (can be extracted for reuse)
- Email service: Nodemailer setup in auth service (can be extracted for reuse)

### Frontend
- TypeScript types pattern: Established in `frontend/src/types/auth.types.ts`
- API service pattern: Established in `frontend/src/services/auth.service.ts`
- Form validation pattern: React Hook Form + Joi validation
- Error handling pattern: Consistent error display across components
- Loading states pattern: Consistent loading UI across forms

## Development Learnings

### From User Registration & Email Verification Feature:

**Technical Patterns Established:**
- **Backend Service Layer:** Clean separation between controllers, services, and models
- **Validation Strategy:** Joi validation in controllers + TypeScript types for compile-time safety
- **Error Handling:** Consistent error response format using response utilities
- **Security Practices:** bcrypt for passwords, JWT for tokens, rate limiting for endpoints
- **Email Integration:** Nodemailer setup with environment-based configuration

**Frontend Patterns Established:**
- **Next.js 14 App Router:** Proper page structure and metadata handling
- **Form Management:** React Hook Form for complex forms with validation
- **API Integration:** Fetch-based service layer with proper TypeScript typing
- **UI/UX Patterns:** Loading states, error handling, success feedback
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS

**Reusable Components for Future Features:**
- Rate limiting middleware (extract to shared middleware)
- JWT token utilities (extract to shared auth utilities)
- Email service (extract to shared communication service)
- Form validation patterns (create reusable form components)
- API error handling (standardize across all services)

**Recommendations for Next Features:**
1. Extract JWT utilities to shared auth service
2. Create reusable form components based on established patterns
3. Standardize API error handling across all frontend services
4. Consider extracting email service for broader use
5. Implement consistent loading and error UI components
